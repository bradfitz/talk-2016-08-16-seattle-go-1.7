* Welcome

Let's celebrate the release of Go1.7.

* Welcome

This event is fork of [[https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Go-1.6-release-party][Go1.6 release party]] by @davecheney. It's not the world wide event like before ... 😭

This presentation is based _heavily_ on the [[https://golang.org/doc/go1.7][official Go 1.7 release notes]].

* History

2008-03: initial brainstorming
2009-11: Go open source
201x-xx: bunch of weekly & rNN releases
2012-03: Go1

Go 1 introduced the [[https://golang.org/doc/go1compat.html][Go 1 compatibility guarantee]].

2013-05: Go1.1

Too long.

* Six month release cycles

Decided to do 6 month release cycles.

3 months of hacking, 3 months of stability.

* Go 1.x

2013-05: Go1.1
2013-12: Go1.2
2014-06: Go1.3
2014-12: Go1.4

Then observed we were on a summer & winter holiday cycle, which
sucked. Did a one-time adjustment with an 8 month cycle to shift the
pattern:

2015-08: Go1.5 (Go now written in Go)
2016-02: Go1.6

* Go 1.7

Go 1.7 was released yesterday (Monday Aug 15th).

6 months after Go 1.6.

* Go 1.7

Most of its changes are in the implementation of the toolchain, runtime, and libraries.

There are no changes to the language specification.

This is intentional. See [[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JsCKdK_AvDdn8EkummMNvpo7ntqteWQfynq9hFTCkhQ/present][my GopherconIndia presentation]] ("Introducing Go 1.6: asymptotically approaching boring")

* New ports

macOS 10.12 Sierra (maybe! Go 1.7 might work. Go 1.6.3 did but now won't. Maybe Go 1.6.4 will.)

Experimental port to Linux on z Systems (linux/s390x)

The beginning of a port to Plan 9 on ARM (plan9/arm)

* Tools

- Go vet

* Compiler Toolchain (SSA)

This release includes a new code generation back end for 64-bit x86 systems.

The new back end, based on SSA, generates more compact, more efficient code and provides a better platform for optimizations such as bounds check elimination. The new back end reduces the CPU time required by official benchmark programs by *5-35%*.

For this release, the new back end can be disabled by passing `-ssa=0` to the compiler.

* Compiler Toolchain (New export)

The format of exported metadata written by the compiler in package archives has changed: the old textual format has been replaced by a more compact *binary* *format*.

This results in somewhat *smaller* *package* *archives* and fixes a few long-standing corner case bugs.

For this release, the new export format can be disabled by passing `-newexport=0` to the compiler.

* Compiler Toolchain (Linker)

The compiler and linker have been optimized and run *significantly* *faster* in this release than in Go 1.6, although they are still slower than we would like and will continue to be optimized in future releases.

* Compiler Toolchain (Compilation time improvements)

Because of translation from C to Go in Go1.5, compile times are slower than they used to be... around 3x slower than 1.4.3.

Now the slowdown is 2.2x than 1.4.3 🎉

* Compiler Toolchain (Linker time improvements)

> 10% faster for any non trivial binary, and up to 30% faster for large binaries like jujud.

* Compiler Toolchain (Stack frame)

On x86-64 systems, Go programs now maintain stack frame pointers as expected by profiling tools like Linux's perf and Intel's VTune, making it easier to analyze and optimize Go programs using these tools.

The frame pointer maintenance has a small run-time overhead that varies but averages around 2%. We hope to reduce this cost in future releases.

To build a toolchain that does not use frame pointers, set GOEXPERIMENT=noframepointer when running make.bash, make.bat, or make.rc.

* Compiler Toolchain (-X option)

The linker's `-X` option no longer supports the unusual two-argument form -X name value, as announced in the Go 1.6 release and in warnings printed by the linker,

   $ go build -ldflags="-X main.Commit $GIT_COMMIT"

Use -X name=value instead,

   $ go build -ldflags="-X main.Commit=$GIT_COMMIT"

* Go command

The go command's basic operation is unchanged, but there are a number of changes worth noting.

- Removes support for the `GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT` environment variable
- "go list" now includes a StaleReason field explaining why a particular package is or is not considered stale 
- Supports import paths referring to [[git.openstack.org][git.openstack.org]]

* Go command (Binary-only package)

This release adds experimental, minimal support for building programs using binary-only packages, packages distributed in binary form without the corresponding source code.

The minimal source code for a binary-only package,

    //go:binary-only-package

    package hello

Full example is on [[https://github.com/tcnksm/go-binary-only-package][tcnksm/go-binary-only-package]]

* Go Vet (-tests)

Adds a new `-tests` check that checks the name and signature of likely test functions.

    func TestbadSuffix(*testing.T) {} // ERROR "first letter after 'Test' must not be lowercase"

* Go Vet (-lostcancel)

Add a new `-lostcancel` that checks which detects failure to call the cancelation function returned by the `WithCancel`, `WithTimeout`, and `WithDeadline` functions in Go 1.7's new context package.

    func _() {
        ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel()
        defer cancel() // ok
    }

    func _() {
        ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel() // ERROR "the cancel function is not used on all paths \(possible context leak\)"
    } // ERROR "this return statement may be reached without using the cancel var defined on line 17"         

* Performance

* Performance

As always, the changes are so general and varied that precise statements about performance are difficult to make.

Most programs should run a bit faster, due to speedups in the garbage collector and optimizations in the core library.

On x86-64 systems, many programs will run significantly faster, due to improvements in generated code brought by the new compiler back end. The code generation changes alone typically reduce program CPU time by *5-35%*.

There have been significant optimizations bringing more than *10%* improvements to implementations in the crypto/sha1, crypto/sha256, encoding/binary, fmt, hash/adler32, hash/crc32, hash/crc64, image/color, math/big, strconv, strings, unicode, and unicode/utf16 packages.

* Performance (GC)

Garbage collection pauses should be significantly shorter than they were in Go 1.6 for programs with large numbers of idle goroutines, substantial stack size fluctuation, or large package-level variables.

* Context

Go 1.7 moves the [[golang.org/x/net/context][golang.org/x/net/context]] package into the standard library as `context`. This allows the use of contexts for cancelation, timeouts, and passing request-scoped data in other standard library packages, including net, net/http, and os/exec

New interface (contract) for passing cancellation signal and scoped values (like request token). 

- [[https://blog.golang.org/context][Go Concurrency Patterns: Context]]
- [[https://peter.bourgon.org/blog/2016/07/11/context.html][Context]] by Peter Bourgon (about `context.Value`)

* Context (net/http)

As a http client, you can pass `Context` by `Request.WithContext()` method.

.code src/context_http.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

As a http handler, you can get the given `Context` by `Request.Context()` method.

.code src/context_http_server.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Context (os/exec)

You can create context-powered `exec.Cmd`

.code src/context_command.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

The provided context is used to kill the process (by calling `os.Process.Kill`) if the context becomes done before the command completes on its own.

* Testing

The testing package now supports the definition of tests with subtests and benchmarks with sub-benchmarks. This support makes it easy to write table-driven benchmarks and to create hierarchical tests. It also provides a way to share common setup and tear-down code.

- [[https://elliot.land/go-subtests-and-sub-benchmarks][Go: Subtests and Sub-benchmarks]]

* Testing (before)

When you want to take benchmark of method `Foo` with different configuration,

.code src/subbench_before.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

You need to define functions for each configuration

* Testing (after)

When you want to take benchmark of method `Foo` with different configuration,

.code src/subbench_after.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

You can use [[https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/TableDrivenTests][table-driven]] approach for benchmark.

* HTTP Tracing

Go 1.7 introduces `net/http/httptrace`, a package that provides mechanisms for tracing events within HTTP requests.

You can set the following hooks to run at various stages of an HTTP client request.

.code src/httptrace.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* HTTP Tracing

You can pass `httptrace` hooks via `Context`

.play src/httptrace_req.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/


* Standard library

And a lot of minor changes 👍
